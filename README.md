# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects focusing on classification and regression problems.

## 1. Medical Cost EDA and Prediction
- Model: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
- Problem Type: Classification, Regression
- Objective:
-   EDA to identify the key drivers to medical cost
-   Logistic regression to classify medical cost into high and low group
-   Linear regression to predict actual medical cost
- Workflow: use traditional steps including using Q-Q plot and Shapiro-Wilk test for linear regression

## 2. Titanic Survival Classification
- Model: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Problem Type: Classification
- Accuracy: ~84%
- Objective: Predict passenger survival
- Workflow:
-   Implement a pipeline to combine preprocessing steps with a machine learning model
-   Use cross-validation and a hyperparameter grid search to optimize ml pipeline
